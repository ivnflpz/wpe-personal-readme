# My personal README
Hello, welcome to my personal README. Hopefully this will help you understand me better and help us establish a better working relationship as we work together on Team Electrum.  

## My Goals

My goals at WP Engine include:
- Delivering the best quality code possible in a reasonable amount of time
- Facilitate product delivery and communication on Team Electrum
- Be available to the team whenever needed
- Working on technologies that excite me
- Learning as much as I can

## Things you should know about me
I've never been an early morning person and I dread waking up for those _early_ morning meetings. I've been doing astrophotography for a little over a year now which means I regularly stay up really late monitoring that night's session. It has solidified my stance as night owl.

I have two pets, dog and cat, and occasionally they'll be making noise during a meeting. My cat likes to scream around the house in the mornings, so I apologize in advance!

My fiance and I like to have lunch together away from our desks whenever possible. I'll generally try to avoid scheduling a meeting over lunch but I'm flexible when the need arises. 

I currently don't have a preference towards the type of work I do. I'm enjoying a healthy 50/50 or so split in backend/frontend work today, but I'm happy to focus on whichever part of the stack the team needs me to be on.

## What I Value
- 3 of my top 5 strengths fall under the "executing" theme. As such I enjoy getting things done instead of falling into [analysis paralysis](https://sourcemaking.com/antipatterns/analysis-paralysis).
- Fast feedback for code reviews, but also thorough
- "Hearing about the pregnancy" - I love learning about the steps/hurdles necessary to arrive at a solution. I find that being aware of those experiences will help you avoid those same hurdles in future projects. 
- Observability and accountability into our systems
- Detailed documentation
- Having a clear agenda for meetings

## The Day-To-Day

### PRs & Code reviews
I generally try to review every PR that gets sent my way and will do my best to look at every single line of code to provide detailed feedback if time permits. I look at my pending code reviews several times throughout the day and the best way for me to look at your PR is to re-request a review. I find GitHub emails to be too noisy and ignore them for the most part. 

I look at a lot of PRs and I always appreciate when the PR description is fully fleshed out with the main goals and testing instructions. Having the full context of what I'm about to review, greatly speeds up the review and allows me to provide better feedback to you. As such, I try to make all my PRs have enough information to facilitate your review too. One other benefit is that whenever I've had to look at old PRs from months/years ago, the PR has all the context necessary and I don't have to go look for Jira tickets or Slack conversations! 

When providing feedback, I've gotten into the habit of using [emojis](https://github.com/erikthedeveloper/code-review-emoji-guide) to help convey intention and meaning to my comments. I think its fairly effective but I'm always open to trying out other approaches!

When giving me feedback, feel free to be as direct as you need to if that will speed up your review process. If I need more clarification, I have no issue with reaching out to you. 

### Communication
I prefer asynchronous communication via Slack as much as possible, but I still try to be as responsive as possible if I'm not in a meeting. While Slack should be the go-to form of communication, I'm always open to jumping on a Zoom call to speed up a resolution.

I use Clockwise on my calendar which dynamically creates "Focus time" blocks for me, but feel free to schedule a meeting or reach out to me during any of those blocks. I only ask that you try to group meetings together if possible.

### 1-1s
I like to have 1-1s once per sprint to talk about anything on your mind. Feel free to bring up any technical topics you'd like to dig into! This is your time, however, so I'm happy to talk about anything you wish or nothing at all if you're not finding the meetings useful. My goal for these meetings is to build rapport so we can work better as a team. 

## StrengthsFinder

### My Top 5
1. Learner: People exceptionally talented in the Learner theme have a great desire to learn and want to continuously improve. The process of learning, rather than the outcome, excites them.
2. Analytical: People exceptionally talented in the Analytical theme search for reasons and causes. They have the ability to think about all of the factors that might affect a situation.
3. Achiever: People exceptionally talented in the Achiever theme work hard and possess a great deal of stamina. They take immense satisfaction in being busy and productive.
4. Arranger: People exceptionally talented in the Arranger theme can organize, but they also have a flexibility that complements this ability. They like to determine how all of the pieces and resources can be arranged for maximum productivity.
5. Focus: People exceptionally talented in the Focus theme can take a direction, follow through and make the corrections necessary to stay on track. They prioritize, then act.

### My Bottom 5
If you send me $40, I'll tell you.
