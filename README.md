# My personal README
Hello, welcome to my personal README. Hopefully this will help you understand me better and help us establish a better working relationship as we work together on Team Planet Express.  

## My Goals

My goal at WP Engine include:
- delivering the best quality code possible in a reasonable amount of time
- be available to the team whenever needed
- working on things that excite me
- learning as much as I can
- make portal development easier for everyone

## Things you should know about me
I'm not a morning person and dread any time I have to wake up _early_ for a meeting. I have two pets (dog and cat) and occasionally they'll be making noise during a meeting (my cat likes to scream every morning). 

These days I prefer frontend work over working in Rails. That's not to say I don't find it interesting or that it can't change. At my previous job, I preferred backend and had a 90/10 backend/frontend split. 

## What I Value
- 3 of my top 5 strengths fall under the "executing" theme. As such I enjoy getting things done.
- Having a clear agenda for meetings
- Fast feedback for code reviews, but also thorough
- Detailed documentation

## The Day-To-Day

### PRs & Code reviews
I generally try to review every PR that gets sent my way. I will do my best to look at every single line of code and provide detailed feedback if time permits. This can occassionally eat up the whole day and I only end up doing code reviews. In the past, I've set up code review hours to alleviate this a bit, and planning to do it again as code reviews have gotten out of hand.

When providing feedback for my PRs, feel free to be blunt as you need to if that will speed up your review process. If I need more clarification on your feedback, I have no issue with reaching out to you. 

### Communication
I prefer asynchronous communication via slack as much as possible, but I still try to be as responsive as possible if I'm not in a meeting. 

### Adhoc pair programming
Unfortunately not everything can be resolved in slack. These days it feels like every day is filled with meetings, but I'm always available to get on a Zoom call and help you work through some issue you're dealing with. However, I'm not a fan of pair programming so I like helping you get unblocked/started instead of working through the entire ticket together.

## StrengthsFinder

### My Top 5
1. Learner: People exceptionally talented in the Learner theme have a great desire to learn and want to continuously improve. The process of learning, rather than the outcome, excites them.
2. Analytical: People exceptionally talented in the Analytical theme search for reasons and causes. They have the ability to think about all of the factors that might affect a situation.
3. Achiever: People exceptionally talented in the Achiever theme work hard and possess a great deal of stamina. They take immense satisfaction in being busy and productive.
4. Arranger: People exceptionally talented in the Arranger theme can organize, but they also have a flexibility that complements this ability. They like to determine how all of the pieces and resources can be arranged for maximum productivity.
5. Focus: People exceptionally talented in the Focus theme can take a direction, follow through and make the corrections necessary to stay on track. They prioritize, then act.

### My Bottom 5
If you send me $40, I'll tell you.
